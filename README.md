I deployed the apps service in Heroku using Github Actions for CI/CD, you can check in Github Actions in this project and you can check SAST (Static Application Security Testing) and DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) Report in Artifacts Build Github Actions. 

You can check configuration deploy on : 
```
.github/workflows/appsecure.yml.
```

Security Vulnerability Check :
```
- sast-scan (SAST) : https://github.com/AppThreat/sast-scan (bandit, gitleaks, depscan) 
- OWASP ZAP (DAST) : https://github.com/marketplace/actions/owasp-zap-full-scan
```   

To answer about question "explanation of what you are implementing to secure the application and/ or server" :

- Implementation SSDLC (Secure Software Development Lifecycle) for Development
- Implementation Firewall for Adding Secure Layer Apps and Networks
- Validation and Configuration must be compliance for example unused port in server must be closed and for application must be explicit validation to preventing injection point
- Use management store credentials
- Educate specific people who manage apps and network like security awareness, secure configuration/code, and etc for reduce human error.
